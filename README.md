# PHP-CRUD
Here I make a code for CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE )Operation  you can learn here the basic crud operation in PHP

Firstly make a database connection in PHP, make a file name config.php where you established your database connection with SQL,
Second, Now make a new file insert.php where you make a code or query to insert a record in the database 
Third,  Make a file name read.php where you will fetch a record and show it in the table  and make here a SELECT query to fetch data 
Fourth, MAKE A file name update.php where you will update the record in the database 
Fifth, Make a query to delete a file from a database in delete.php
